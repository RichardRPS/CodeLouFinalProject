My wife is hosting a trip to Spain for her students at the Presbyterian Seminary.  It will be a hike on a 100 mile section of the Camino de Santiago which 
is an ancient path from southern France to Santiago Spain.  They can take 20 students so the purpose of this page is the front end to invite the students who are interested
to sign up and express their interest and get some basic info about the trip like cost, distances and such. 

The short JavaScript is just an excuse to add some js.  The short form is another excuse to meet the criteria - I hope.  I tried to do this without any help like Bootstrap or JQuery
since it was to be all custom.  I hope it passes. Thanks you.  Richard

P.S. Just after this was sumbitted I noticed that the destinations page link for the destinations button was missing.  Not sure how that happened but I added it just now - even though it is a blank page. Rich
